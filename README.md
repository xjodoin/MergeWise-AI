## **Features**

- **Automated Inline Comments**: Provides precise, line-by-line feedback, highlighting potential issues, bugs, and code quality improvements.
- **Contextual Analysis**: Incorporates merge request descriptions and comments to deliver relevant, tailored insights.
- **Test Coverage Verification**: Detects newly added code and assesses if adequate tests are included.
- **Language Flexibility**: Supports Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Dart, and more.
- **Seamless Integration with GitLab CI**: Runs automatically on every merge request, integrating directly into your CI pipeline.

## **Getting Started**

These instructions will guide you through setting up and running MergeWise AI in your GitLab CI pipeline.

### **Prerequisites**

- **GitLab Personal Access Token**: Ensure it has API access to read and comment on merge requests.
- **OpenAI API Key**: Required to interact with OpenAIâ€™s models.
- **Python 3.x**: Required to run the MergeWise AI script in your GitLab CI environment.

### **Installation**

1. Clone or download this repository to your project.

2. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install requests openai
   ```

3. Add the necessary environment variables in GitLab:

   - `GITLAB_TOKEN`: Your GitLab personal access token.
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key.

   > **Note**: Make sure to set these as protected variables in GitLab to keep them secure.

## **Usage**

### **Setting Up MergeWise AI in GitLab CI**

Add the following job to your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to integrate MergeWise AI:

```yaml
stages:
  - code_review

code_review:
  stage: code_review
  image: python:3.8
  script:
    - pip install requests openai
    - python code_review.py
  rules:
    - if: '$CI_MERGE_REQUEST_IID'
  variables:
    GITLAB_TOKEN: $GITLAB_TOKEN
    OPENAI_API_KEY: $OPENAI_API_KEY
```

This configuration will run the `code_review.py` script on every merge request in the repository, automatically providing in-line feedback on code changes.

### **Running the Script Locally**

To test the script locally:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up a `.env` file with the required environment variables:

   ```plaintext
   GITLAB_TOKEN=<your_gitlab_token>
   OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_openai_key>
   CI_API_V4_URL=https://gitlab.com/api/v4  # Or your GitLab instance API URL
   CI_PROJECT_ID=<project_id>
   CI_MERGE_REQUEST_IID=<merge_request_iid>
   ```

3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python code_review.py
   ```

---

## **Configuration**

### **Environment Variables**

- **`GITLAB_TOKEN`**: Personal access token for GitLab.
- **`OPENAI_API_KEY`**: OpenAI API key.
- **`CI_API_V4_URL`**: GitLab API URL (default: `https://gitlab.com/api/v4`).
- **`CI_PROJECT_ID`**: Project ID for the GitLab project.
- **`CI_MERGE_REQUEST_IID`**: Merge Request IID.

### **Code Analysis Configuration**

You can configure the script to handle specific languages and adjust prompt settings. Update the `get_language` function in the `code_review.py` file to add support for additional languages.

---

## **Development and Customization**

To extend the functionality of MergeWise AI, consider the following:

- **Additional Languages**: Add mappings in the `get_language` function to support additional file types.
- **Custom Rules**: Define new prompts or adjust the AIâ€™s parameters in the `analyze_code_with_ai` function to apply custom code quality checks.
- **Rate Limiting and Token Optimization**: Adjust OpenAIâ€™s `max_tokens` parameter as needed for large projects with extensive descriptions and comments.

---

## **Examples**

### **Inline Comment Example**

MergeWise AI will analyze code line by line and post comments such as:

> **Issue on `file.py:23`**  
> The variable `x` is used but never defined. Consider defining it or removing it if unused.

### **Global Comment Example**

For overall issues or advice, MergeWise AI posts global comments like:

> **General Feedback**  
> This merge request introduces new logic in `module.js` but lacks corresponding test coverage. Adding tests would ensure reliability.
